```{r}
library(readr)

data <- read_csv('Housing.csv')
head(data)
data[1:5]

```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(rsample)

housing <- data[1:5]
housing_split <- initial_split(housing) #rsample helps split the housing data using 
training_data <- training(housing_split) # training and testing fxns
testing_data  <- testing(housing_split)

```

Now loading the recipes package, we can do some fmefp

Feature Engineering
Missing values
Encoding categorical variables -- Vectorization
Feature scaling
Preprocessing

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(recipes)

training_data %>%  #data to pipe into the recipe
  recipe() %>%  #starts with recipe
   step_normalize(everything()) %>%  #normalize then preprocess
  prep() -> recipe #end with prep

  recipe
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(recipes)

juice(recipe) -> juiced
juiced

```
